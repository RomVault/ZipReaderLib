					  an enhanced contents_signature.
					  There is no local-header version; the following applies
					  only to the central header.  (Last Revision 19961207)

					  (AcTime)      Long        time of last access (UTC/GMT)
					  (CrTime)      Long        time of original creation (UTC/GMT)

					  Flags         Byte        info bits (refers to local header!)
					  (ModTime)     Long        time of last modification (UTC/GMT)

					  The central-header extra field contains the modification time only,
					  or no timestamp at all.  TSize is used to flag its presence or
					  absence.  But note:

						  If "Flags" indicates that Modtime is present in the local header
						  field, it MUST be present in the central header field, too!
						  This correspondence is required because the modification time
						  value may be used to support trans-timezone freshening and
						  updating operations with zip archives.

					  The time values are in standard Unix signed-long format, indicating
					  the number of seconds since 1 January 1970 00:00:00.  The times
					  are relative to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), also sometimes
					  referred to as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  To convert to local time,
					  the software must know the local timezone offset from UTC/GMT.

					  The lower three bits of Flags in both headers indicate which time-
					  stamps are present in the LOCAL extra field:

							bit 0           if set, modification time is present
							bit 1           if set, access time is present
							bit 2           if set, creation time is present
							bits 3-7        reserved for additional timestamps; not set

					  Those times that are present will appear in the order indicated, but
					  any combination of times may be omitted.  (Creation time may be
					  present without access time, for example.)  TSize should equal
					  (1 + 4*(number of set bits in Flags)), as the block is currently
					  defined.  Other timestamps may be added in the future.

					 -Info-ZIP Unix Extra Field (type 1):
					  ==================================

					  The following is the layout of the old Info-ZIP extra block for
					  Unix.  It has been replaced by the extended-timestamp extra block
					  (0x5455) and the Unix type 2 extra block (0x7855).
					  (Last Revision 19970118)

					  TSize         Short       total data size for this block
					  AcTime        Long        time of last access (UTC/GMT)
					  ModTime       Long        time of last modification (UTC/GMT)
					  UID           Short       Unix user ID (optional)

			  (Unix1) 0x5855        Short       tag for this extra block type ("UX")
					  TSize         Short       total data size for this block
					  AcTime        Long        time of last access (GMT/UTC)
					  ModTime       Long        time of last modification (GMT/UTC)

					  The file access and modification times are in standard Unix signed-
					  long format, indicating the number of seconds since 1 January 1970
					  00:00:00.  The times are relative to Coordinated Universal Time
					  (UTC), also sometimes referred to as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT).  To
					  convert to local time, the software must know the local timezone
					  offset from UTC/GMT.  The modification time may be used by non-Unix
					  systems to support inter-timezone freshening and updating of zip
					  archives.

					  The local-header extra block may optionally contain UID and GID
					  info for the file.  The local-header TSize value is the only
					  indication of this.  Note that Unix UIDs and GIDs are usually
					  specific to a particular machine, and they generally require root
					  access to restore.

					  This extra field type is obsolete, but it has been in use since
					  mid-1994.  Therefore future archiving software should continue to
					  support it.  Some guidelines:

						  An archive member should either contain the old "Unix1"
						  extra field block or the new extra field types "time" and/or
						  "Unix2".

						  If both the old "Unix1" block type and one or both of the new
						  block types "time" and "Unix2" are found, the "Unix1" block
						  should be considered invalid and ignored.

						  Unarchiving software should recognize both old and new extra
						  field block types, but the info from new types overrides the
						  old "Unix1" field.

						  Archiving software should recognize "Unix1" extra fields for
						  timestamp comparison but never create it for updated, freshened
						  or new archive members.  When copying existing members to a new
						  archive, any "Unix1" extra field blocks should be converted to
						  the new "time" and/or "Unix2" types.

					 -Info-ZIP Unicode Path Extra Field:
					  =================================

					  Stores the UTF-8 version of the entry path as stored in the

					  (Last Revision 20070912)

					  TSize         Short       total data size for this block
					  Version       Byte        version of this extra field, currently 1
					  NameCRC32     Long        CRC-32 checksum of standard name field
					  UnicodeName   variable    UTF-8 version of the entry file name

					  Currently Version is set to the number 1.  If there is a need
					  to change this field, the version will be incremented.  Changes
					  may not be backward compatible so this extra field should not be
					  used if the version is not recognized.

					  The NameCRC32 is the standard zip CRC32 checksum of the File Name
					  field in the header.  This is used to verify that the header
					  File Name field has not changed since the Unicode Path extra field
					  was created.  This can happen if a utility renames the entry but
					  does not update the UTF-8 path extra field.  If the CRC check fails,
					  this UTF-8 Path Extra Field should be ignored and the File Name field
					  in the header should be used instead.

					  The UnicodeName is the UTF-8 version of the contents of the File
					  Name field in the header, without any trailing NUL.  The standard
					  name field in the Zip entry header remains filled with the entry
					  name coded in the local machine's extended ASCII system charset.
					  As UnicodeName is defined to be UTF-8, no UTF-8 byte order mark
					  (BOM) is used.  The length of this field is determined by
					  subtracting the size of the previous fields from TSize.
					  If both the File Name and Comment fields are UTF-8, the new General
					  Purpose Bit Flag, bit 11 (Language encoding flag (EFS)), should be
					  used to indicate that both the header File Name and Comment fields
					  are UTF-8 and, in this case, the Unicode Path and Unicode Comment
					  extra fields are not needed and should not be created.  Note that,
					  for backward compatibility, bit 11 should only be used if the native
					  character set of the paths and comments being zipped up are already
					  in UTF-8.  The same method, either general purpose bit 11 or extra
					  fields, should be used in both the Local and Central Directory Header
					  for a file.

					  Utilisation rules:
					  1. This field shall never be created for names consisting solely of
						 7-bit ASCII characters.
					  2. On a system that already uses UTF-8 as system charset, this field
						 shall not repeat the string pattern already stored in the Zip
						 entry's standard name field. Instead, a field of exactly 9 bytes
						 (70 75 05 00 01 and 4 bytes CRC) should be created.
						 In this form with 5 data bytes, the field serves as indicator
						 for the UTF-8 encoding of the standard Zip header's name field.
					  3. This field shall not be used whenever the calculated CRC-32 of
						 the entry's standard name field does not match the provided
						 CRC checksum value.  A mismatch of the CRC check indicates that
						 the standard name field was changed by some non-"up"-aware
						 utility without synchronizing this UTF-8 name e.f. block.

					 -Info-ZIP New Unix Extra Field:
					  ====================================

					  Currently stores Unix UIDs/GIDs up to 32 bits.
					  (Last Revision 20080509)

					  Value         Size        Description
					  -----         ----        -----------
			  (UnixN) 0x7875        Short       tag for this extra block type ("ux")
					  TSize         Short       total data size for this block
					  Version       1 byte      version of this extra field, currently 1
					  UIDSize       1 byte      Size of UID field
					  UID           Variable    UID for this entry
					  GIDSize       1 byte      Size of GID field
					  GID           Variable    GID for this entry

					  Currently Version is set to the number 1.  If there is a need
					  to change this field, the version will be incremented.  Changes
					  may not be backward compatible so this extra field should not be
					  used if the version is not recognized.

					  UIDSize is the size of the UID field in bytes.  This size should
					  match the size of the UID field on the target OS.

					  UID is the UID for this entry in standard little endian format.

					  GIDSize is the size of the GID field in bytes.  This size should
					  match the size of the GID field on the target OS.

					  GID is the GID for this entry in standard little endian format.

					  If both the old 16-bit Unix extra field (tag 0x7855, Info-ZIP Unix2)
					  and this extra field are present, the values in this extra field
					  supercede the values in that extra field.
